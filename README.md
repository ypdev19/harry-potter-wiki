# Harry Potter wiki ⚡💥

A basic Wiki app about my favorite book/movie saga.

What it does
--------------------------------

As default load, it gets all students from all Hogwarts houses, each student basic info is represented with a card and the list is paginated.
As an additional option to apply a more specific search, there's a filter available to search the students by a specific house.
